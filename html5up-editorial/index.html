										<h2>Concept</h2>
									</header>
									<p>VicTest is inspired by content control softwares - also known as content filters - to create a more secure and reliable testing system for university students and staff from Victoria University of Wellington (VUW). VicTest is a web-based server software that will be accessible through the VUW website. By conducting online testing through a separate web-based server software (and not being conducted in <a href="https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz ">Blackboard</a> as of currently) we are able to have more control of what can be accessed by the staff and student. In this way it can be designed more securely by incorporating features like auto-device lockdown and more, to minimize students from cheating in their tests.</p>

									<p>The current VUW testing website is accessed and conducted in Blackboard. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_Learn ">Wikipedia</a>, Blackboard ‘is Web-based server software which features course management, customizable open architecture, and scalable design that allows integration with student information systems and authentication protocols. It may be installed on local servers or hosted by Blackboard ASP Solutions. Its main purposes are to add online elements to courses traditionally delivered face-to-face and to develop completely online courses with few or no face-to-face meetings’. Due to Blackboard focusing mostly on delivery of contents between teacher and student and not fully on how they provide a secure testing experience, there are many ways students are able to cheat their tests. </p>

									<p>By incorporating new features used by successful content control softwares into VicTests, we are able to minimize the probability of a student cheating on their online test. This is to ensure that the online test results are valid, which will be critical when producing reliable student academic records.</p>

								<p>This is designed for students and staff from Victoria University of Wellington, ranging from staff who have access to the testing system and students from all possible year levels that partake in the online tests. This will be available for every student and staff with a laptop or computer with an accessible web camera and strong internet connection.</p>
