                                    <p>The information gathered through <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/">Google Forms</a> are from current Victoria University students. They have been notified of this project prior to them completing the survey. All information are kept confidential and the students have been informed of this. No student was forced to answer the questions if they felt uncomfortable to do so.

                                    <ul>
                                        <p> 
										<h4>How long do you have to complete your test?</h4>
                                        <li>Somewhere between 24 and 72 hours (usually)</li>
										<li>If it’s a timed one-off test, perhaps around 30 minutes to an hour. If they are deadline based, perhaps a few days to a few weeks.</li>
										<li>Unlimited time limit</li>
                                    	<li>Ranging from a minimum of 2-3 hours with only one chance to do the test to 2-3 days having more than once chance to do the test.</li>
									</p>
									</ul>

									<ul>
                                        <p> 
										<h4>Is your test open book or closed book?</h4>
										<div class="img1"><img src="images/graph.png" alt="graph" /></div>
									</p>
									</ul>
									
									<ul>
                                        <p> 
										<h4>If it’s open book how do you access information that can assist you on answering the exam questions?</h4>
                                        <li>Lecture Slides, Google, Lecture Recordings</li>
										<li>My annotated lecture notes as well as practice questions previously completed</li>
										<li>I Google them</li>
                                    	<li>I access information through the internet or through the lecture slides given to us</li>
									</p>
									</ul>

									<ul>
                                        <p> 
										<h4>If its closed book how have you managed to find a way to get information for the answer that would otherwise be considered as “cheating”?</h4>
                                        <li>Conferring with other students regarding the contents of the tests/exams while test/exam is active</li>
									</p>
									</ul>

									<ul>
                                        <p> 
										<h4>What are ways your peers have cheated the Victoria university online tests?</h4>
                                        <li>Voice calls to collaborate with each other when attempting a test. Revealing test questions/answers to each other</li>
										<li>I’m not sure if this is considered cheating, but by using Google</li>
										<li>Helping each other in tests, giving useful links to where the answer could be found or can help in getting to the right answer</li>
									</p>
									</ul>

									<ul>
                                        <p> 
										<h4>What would you recommend could be integrated or improved to ensure that there is a lower probability that a student can cheat on their online tests?</h4>
                                        <li>Perhaps implementing a tool that restricts the student from exiting a window/tab</li>
										<li>I’d recommend doing the test while live on Zoom</li>
										<li>Possibly having them in an online class. Or having some sort of tracking on tabbing in and out of the test window.</li>
                                    	<li>Verbal Tests/Examinations – One way to assess true understanding of content is through a 1-1 technical interview. This gives almost no room for students to interact with other students when undertaking a test/exam as they are under the supervision of the interviewer/assessor at all times. Questions asked should vary with each student as much as possible (this will prevent students from revealing the questions to students that have yet to attempt the interview) whilst maintaining fairness in terms of difficulty.
										<br><br>Remove tests and exams all together – By removing them we completely eliminate any probability of students cheating on tests/exams because there are no tests/exams for them to cheat on.
										</li>
